> This is a fork of the official repository (located [here](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique)).
We are working on various features for our own version of the bot. However, we will
regularly merge upstream changes and will also create pull requests to merge back our
features to the upstream repo at some point.

The remainder of this readme is from the original repo.

======

Botamusique is a mumble bot which goal is to allow users to listen music together with its audio output.
Predicted functionnalities will be the one you could expect from any classic music player.

Bot the can play :
- Radio url
- Youtube/Soundcloud URL (everything supported by youtube-dl)
- Local folder (disabled, I need to work on the web interface)

#### Web interface
* Disable * I need to work on it. Since I use this bot for radio, youtube/soundcloud and folder music, the web interace isn't ready.

You need to create a folder for all your music. Organize your music by subfolder.
The main folder need to be declare into the config (with a '/' at the end)

#### Installation
1. You need python 3 with opuslib and protobuf (look at the requirement of pymumble)
2. The Bot use ffmpeg, so you know what you have to do if ffmpeg aren't in your package manager. I personally use [this repository](http://repozytorium.mati75.eu/) on my raspberry.

commands (don't forget the sudo mode):
```
apt install python3-pip
apt install ffmpeg
apt install youtube-dl
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/azlux/botamusique.git
cd ./botamusique
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x ./mumbleBot.py
```

#### Starting the bot
`./mumbleBot.py -s HOST -u BOTNAME -P PASSWORD -p PORT -c CHANNEL`

The bot listen to the 8181 port so you should redirect to this one in you NAT configuration to let others peoples access the web interface. (DISABLED)
