# botamusique
[Version Fran√ßaise ici](README.fr.md)

======

Botamusique is a mumble bot which goal is to allow users to listen music together with its audio output.
Predicted functionnalities will be the one you could expect from any classic music player.

1. Where to start

You need to create a folder for all your music. Organize your music by subfolder.
The main folder need to be declare into the config (with a '/' at the end)

#### Installation
1. You need python 3 with opuslib and protobuf (look at the requirement of pymumble)
   (Hint pyenv is a good start to get the requirements, search pyenv-installer)
2. The Bot use ffmpeg, so you know what you have to do if ffmpeg aren't in your package manager. I personally use [this repository](http://repozytorium.mati75.eu/) on my raspberry.

commands (don't forget the sudo mode):
```
pip3 install opuslib
pip3 install protobuf
pip3 install flask
apt-get install ffmpeg
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/azlux/MumbleRadioPlayer.git
cd ./MumbleRadioPlayer
chmod +x ./mumbleRadioPlayer.py
```

#### Starting the bot
./mumbleBot.py -s HOST -u BOTNAME -P PASSWORD -p PORT -c CHANNEL

The bot listen to the 8181 port so you should redirect to this one in you NAT configuration to let others peoples access the web interface.
